# Major UX Overhaul - v2.0.0 🎉

## Overview
This PR completely reimagines the Magic Four² gameplay experience, transforming it from a row-by-row puzzle into a modern, intuitive full-grid experience with Wordle-style feedback and clean design.

## 🎯 Key Changes

### 1. Full Grid Editing
- **Before**: Players could only fill one row at a time
- **After**: Type in any cell, work on any riddle in any order
- **Why**: More flexible, less restrictive gameplay

### 2. Symmetric Auto-Fill
- Letters automatically fill both row AND column positions
- Reflects the magic square property (rows = columns)
- Visual feedback shows which cell was auto-filled
- **Example**: Type "S" in [0,0] → automatically fills [0,0] as well

### 3. Smart Validation & Feedback
- **Wordle-Style Colors**:
  - 🟢 Green = Correct position
  - 🟡 Yellow = Right letter, wrong position  
  - ⚫ Gray = Incorrect letter
- **Smart Clearing**: Wrong letters fade to gray, then auto-clear after 2.5s
- **Keep Progress**: Correct letters stay in place

### 4. Global Hints System (2 per game)
- **Before**: Unlimited hints on each riddle
- **After**: 2 hints total via global 💡 button
- Hints appear inline when revealed
- Makes game more challenging and strategic

### 5. Welcome Modal
- Shows on first visit
- 3 simple steps explaining gameplay
- Accessible via "?" button in header
- Supports English & Hebrew

### 6. Clean, Modern Design
- Removed borders and backgrounds from riddles
- Larger, more readable fonts (17px)
- Black circular number badges
- Grid labels (1-4) matching riddle numbers
- Wordle-style minimalist aesthetic

### 7. Clear Grid Button
- One-click to clear all letters
- Keyboard shortcut: Escape key
- Subtle secondary action (doesn't compete with Check Answer)
