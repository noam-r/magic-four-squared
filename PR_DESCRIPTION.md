# UI Polish & Hebrew Language Support

## Summary
This PR enhances the UI with professional SVG icons, improves the header layout, fixes grid label alignment, and adds proper Hebrew final form letter support.

## Changes

### 🎨 Professional SVG Icons
- Replaced emoji buttons with clean, scalable SVG icons
- Hints button: Question mark in circle
- Help button: Lightbulb  
- Editor link: Edit/pencil icon

### 🎯 Improved Header Layout
- Restructured to three-column grid: hints (left), title (center), help (right)
- Changed hints button from orange to purple for color harmony
- Help button now has subtle outlined style
- Better visual balance and spacing

### 📐 Fixed Grid Label Alignment
- Removed hardcoded widths causing misalignment
- Used CSS Grid structure matching main grid
- Added RTL-aware positioning with `margin-inline-start`
- Labels now perfectly align with grid cells in both LTR and RTL

### 🇮🇱 Hebrew Final Form Normalization
